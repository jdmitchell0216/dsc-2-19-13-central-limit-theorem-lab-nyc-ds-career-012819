Instead, the distribution begins to approximate a normal distribution as it gets larger and larger.  Generally, 30 is accepted as the number for sample size where the Central Limit Theorem begins to kick in--however, there are no magic numbers when it comes to probability. On average, and only on average, a sample distribution of sample means where the individual sample sizes were 29 would only be slightly less normal, while one with sample sizes of 31 would likely only be slightly more normal.  \n",
